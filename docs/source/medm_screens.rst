============

The following shows the MEDM screen that is used to control the Andor detector. Note that the general purpose screen ADBase.adl can be used, but it exposes a few controls that are not applicable to the Andor, and lacks some fields that are important for the Andor.

Andor.adl is the main screen used to control the Andor driver.
